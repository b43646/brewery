= Spring Cloud Brewery on OpenShift

== Overview

This guides walks you through to setup https://github.com/kameshsampath/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery] on
https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift]. The steps in this guide could be the first step or a Proof of Technology(PoT)
on how to migrate an existing Spring Cloud/Boot application on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

In the process of migration, the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
will be modified to make it deployable on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

The application will be migrated based on these iterations,

* [*] <<iteration-1>> - As-is deployment of the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
with minimal or no code change

* [*] <<iteration-2>> - Will use native OpenShift/Kubernetes features such as service discovery, loadbalancing & externalization of the config

* [] Iteration III - Replace RabbitMQ with JBoss A-MQ

* [] Iteration IV - Service Mesh with https://istio.io[Istio]

== Pre-Requisite

You have a OpenShift cluster running locally using https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[*minishift*]
or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/Op[*CDK*], or
have access to https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[*OpenShift Container Platform*]

[WARNING]
====
- At least 7Gb of RAM is required to run the Brewery application
- Openshift Origin 1.4.1 is required till we have fixed this https://gist.github.com/cmoulliard/46a804a42648761b1fd8be4f61444dc3[issue]
- You can boost the deployment if you pull these docker images used by the s2i process `docker pull fabric8/s2i-java:2.0` and `docker pull fabric8/java-jboss-openjdk8-jdk:1.2`
====

[NOTE]
====
This is needed only in OpenShift and applicable for iteations 2 and above

`oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)`
====

== Accessing the Applications

You can view the application urls from OpenShift Web Console.  A successful deployment  will have all the applications running with single pod. The following screenshots
shows how the <<deploy-eureka,Eureka>> will look like when all the clients registers with it
